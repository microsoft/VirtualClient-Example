# This file is used to define the artifact folders and files that will be published to the
# package stores (e.g. CloudVault, Reddog). This file is copied to the build output directory
# during build, so the paths below are relative to that /out folder.

# Exclude everything in the /out folder from publishing except the folders that contain
# NuGet or Pilotfish packages (note: backslash makes it work on windows-based agents).
